# GitHub-Actions
- GitHub Actions is a platform that automates tasks in the software development lifecycle.
- It's a continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) tool that allows users to automate building, testing, and deploying software. 

## What can GitHub Actions do?
- Automate tasks like building, testing, and deploying software.
- Create workflows that run when events occur in a repository, like when a pull request is opened or an issue is created. 
- Run workflows to test code on different operating systems or in different versions of a programming language 
- Create custom continuous integration (CI) workflows

## How does GitHub Actions work? 
- Users configure workflows that contain one or more jobs.
- Each job runs in its own virtual machine runner or in a container.
- Jobs can run in sequential order or in parallel.
- GitHub provides virtual machines for Linux, Windows, and macOS, but users can also host their own runners.

## How can users use GitHub Actions?
- Users can create actions, which are reusable extensions that can simplify workflows.
- Users can use a matrix strategy to run multiple related jobs based on the same job definition.
- Users can use Docker containers to package the environment with the GitHub Actions code.

## Comparing with Jenkins 

### Advantages of GitHub Actions over Jenkins

- Hosting: Jenkins is self-hosted, meaning it requires its own server to run, while GitHub Actions is hosted by GitHub and runs directly in your GitHub repository.

- User interface: Jenkins has a complex and sophisticated user interface, while GitHub Actions has a more streamlined and user-friendly interface that is better suited for simple to moderate automation tasks.

- Cost: Jenkins can be expensive to run and maintain, especially for organizations with large and complex automation needs. GitHub Actions, on the other hand, is free for open-source projects and has a tiered pricing model for private repositories, making it more accessible to smaller organizations and individual developers.

### Advantages of Jenkins over GitHub Actions

- Integration: Jenkins can integrate with a wide range of tools and services, but GitHub Actions is tightly integrated with the GitHub platform, making it easier to automate tasks related to your GitHub workflow.

In conclusion, Jenkins is better suited for complex and large-scale automation tasks, while GitHub Actions is a more cost-effective and user-friendly solution for simple to moderate automation needs.
